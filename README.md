# Just Another Matter to Energy Mod
An incomplete mod built with M3EC. Adds one ore, 6 items, and 22 recipes. The ore currently does not generate, I will be fixing this once the fabric documentation updates for 1.17.1.

## FAQ

Q: Will I port / backport this to version X / modloader Y?
A: Usually if it doesn't exist for a given version or modloader, I'm waiting on documentation so that I can update M3EC to support that version and modloader.

Q: Will I backport this to (version prior to 1.12)?
A: Probably not, but the license permits you to do it yourself.

Q: Can I use this mod in X?
A: Yes.

Q: Can I see/use/modify the mod to suit my needs? Can I put this in my modpack?
A: Yes, as the license permits.
